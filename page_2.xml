Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Each router knows to which router the packet needs to be sent based on the routing table it has.

      <pText><![CDATA[In a <span class="PageAudioClass" id="Audio_BTNID" url="en/Sound/Audio_1" headername="Audio">traditional network</span>, when a router is down, another route needs to be identified to transfer the packets. Since there is no centralized control over the routers this becomes a difficult task. So in a traditional network, when a switch is down, it can affect other switches also. Each router in a network has three layers comprising of hardware at the bottom layer, operating system running on top of the hardware and applications on the top most layer. The skeletal view of the traditional network with these layers is shown in Figure 9.3.]]></pText>
