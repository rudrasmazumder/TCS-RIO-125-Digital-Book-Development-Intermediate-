      <pText><![CDATA[Consider the use of SDN for IoT as shown in Figure 9.12. In this there are several IoT devices in different sub-networks. The data from these devices through mobile access channels or fixed access channels are collected and transmitted to the data aggregator. The data aggregation from various IoT devices takes place at the data aggregator and then it passes through a transport network. From there it goes to different gateways and the packet segregation is done at the packet gateways. When we integrate SDN with IoT, we are going to integrate SDN controller with various devices, performs better orchestration of various devices and protocols that are running. Overall it will improve the service logic.]]></pText>
